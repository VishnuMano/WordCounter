This is a test. Hello World.
There are a few different test cases:

	1. Words with	tabs in between them still need to be counted.
	2. Words with  double spaces between them also need to be counted correctly.
	3. Newlines between words need to denote an increment in word
count.
	4. Spaces at the end of a file shouldn't do anything to the word count. -->
